Title: Assorted Header-only C++ Libraries
Description:
    Vendors an assortment of useful header-only C++ libraries.
    Bioconductor packages can use these libraries in their own C++ code by LinkingTo this package without introducing any additional dependencies.
    The use of a central repository avoids duplicate vendoring of libraries across multiple R packages,
    and enables better coordination of version updates across cohorts of interdependent C++ libraries.
Suggests:
    knitr,
